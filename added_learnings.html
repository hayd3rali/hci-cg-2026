            <h2>Self Study</h2>
            <p>
                Effective interface design requires careful thought and iteration. Even
                small design choices—like accounting for real users and involving them
                early—can make the difference between a safe system and a dangerous one.
                The Automatic Syringe case demonstrates how a numeric keypad interface
                enabled a tenfold dosage error, an issue that only came to light after
                feedback from hospital staff.
            </p>

                <h3>Analyzing the Syringe Interface Using Different Models</h3>
                <p>
                    The sections below describe how Norman’s Model, GOMS, and KLM can be used
                    to evaluate the redesign of the syringe interface, where the numeric
                    keypad was replaced with increment and decrement buttons.

                <h4>Norman’s Cycle of Action</h4>
                <p>
                    From Norman’s perspective, the original keypad design created a wide gulf
                    of execution. Although users aimed to set a precise dosage, the interface
                    made it easy to enter a dangerously incorrect value with a single extra
                    keystroke. The redesigned interface narrows this gulf by aligning user
                    intentions with safer, more constrained actions.
                </p>

                <h4>GOMS Model</h4>
                <p>
                    Applying GOMS breaks the dosing task into goals, methods, and operators.
                    While the keypad supports quick data entry, it offers little assistance
                    for spotting or correcting errors. The button-based approach, although
                    slower, requires users to confirm each change, increasing overall safety.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h4>
                <p>
                    KLM is concerned with estimating how long expert users take to complete a
                    task. It would likely show that a keypad enables faster dose entry because
                    it involves fewer actions, whereas button presses take more time. This
                    comparison highlights that speed alone is an inadequate metric for
                    evaluating safety-critical medical interfaces.

                <h4>The Importance of Iteration</h4>
                <p>
                    Because users and environments vary, interface designs rarely succeed on
                    the first try. Developing early prototypes and continuously involving
                    users helps uncover major problems before they become deeply embedded in
                    the final system.

                <h3>Norman’s Model of Interaction</h3>
                <p>
                    Donald Norman is a prominent researcher in Human–Computer Interaction and
                    a strong advocate for user-centered design, usability, and cognitive
                    engineering. His model of interaction is influential because it reflects
                    how people naturally approach and use interactive systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Norman’s model, interaction begins with a user forming a goal and
                    deciding how to achieve it. The user then carries out actions through the
                    interface, observes the system’s response, interprets what happened, and
                    evaluates whether the result satisfies the original goal.
                </p>
            </article>

                <h4>The Seven Stages of Action</h4>
                <p>
                    Norman separates interaction into execution and evaluation phases, which
                    together include seven distinct stages:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Establishing the goal</li>
                    <li>Forming the intention</li>
                    <li>Specifying the action sequence</li>
                    <li>Executing the action</li>
                    <li>Perceiving the system state</li>
                    <li>Interpreting the system state</li>
                    <li>Evaluating the outcome against the goal</li>
                </ol>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation</h4>
                <p>
                    Norman uses this framework to explain difficulties users face with poorly
                    designed systems. The gulf of execution describes the mismatch between a
                    user’s intentions and the actions the system allows. The gulf of
                    evaluation refers to how hard it is for users to understand what the
                    system has done.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Human Error: Slips and Mistakes</h4>
                <p>
                    Human errors are commonly categorized as slips or mistakes. Slips happen
                    when users know what they want to do but perform the wrong action, such as
                    pressing an incorrect key. Mistakes occur when users misunderstand the
                    system and form an incorrect goal, for example by misreading an icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slips can often be minimized through improved interface layout, such as
                    better button spacing. Mistakes usually require more fundamental changes,
                    including redesigning the interface, enhancing training, or clarifying
                    metaphors.

                <h3>GOMS Model</h3>
                <p>
                    The GOMS model, introduced by Card, Moran, and Newell, explains task
                    performance by breaking it into Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection
                    rules. It provides insight into both the mental and physical aspects of
                    user interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goals define what the user wants to accomplish. Operators are basic
                    actions like pressing a key or reading a message. Methods describe the
                    procedures for achieving goals, while selection rules determine which
                    method is chosen in a given situation.

                <h4>Design Focus: Why GOMS Saves Money</h4>
                <p>
                    GOMS has proven useful in real-world evaluations. For instance, the
                    telecommunications company NYNEX used GOMS to assess a proposed system and
                    found it would perform worse than the existing one. The project was
                    cancelled, saving the company millions of dollars.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h3>
                <p>
                    The Keystroke-Level Model is a more detailed form of GOMS that concentrates
                    on predicting task completion time for expert users performing routine
                    activities. It is intended for brief, clearly defined tasks that usually
                    take under 20 seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    KLM assumes users make no errors and focuses solely on the execution
                    stage. Tasks are broken down into low-level operators such as keystrokes,
                    mouse clicks, pointing actions, hand movements, mental preparation, and
                    system response time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By assigning standard time values to each operator and adding them
                    together, KLM allows designers to compare alternative interfaces or task
                    methods and estimate which will be faster, without conducting full user
                    studies.

                <h3>The Automatic Syringe Case</h3>
                <p>
                    The Automatic Syringe case demonstrates how small interface design
                    decisions can lead to serious consequences. Numeric keypads caused
                    dangerous input errors due to accidental key presses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interfaces rarely work perfectly on the first attempt, making
                    iteration essential. Early prototypes should be easy to modify or
                    discard, and rapid prototyping techniques such as paper sketches and
                    mock-ups help designers test ideas quickly before full development.
